# Early-Intervention-Intelligence-EII-for-Cognitive-Development (Autism Prediction)


---

### Project Overview
This project aims to develop a classification model to predict Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using machine learning techniques. The model will be trained on the Autistic Spectrum Disorder Screening Data for Toddlers dataset, which contains influential features for detecting ASD traits in toddlers. By analyzing behavioral features and individual characteristics from the dataset, we aim to build a robust screening method that can assist healthcare professionals in early autism diagnosis.
